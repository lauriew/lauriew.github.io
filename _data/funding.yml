However, rural health care providers and those who have small offices may not have the financial resources or expertise to purchase and maintain necessary expensive hardware and software applications which are necessary to join in this move toward electronic medical records (EMRs). We propose that the EMR application needs of rural and small-practice ambulatory health care providers be satisfied via open source EMR applications that are reliable, secure, privacy-preserving, standards/regulations-based, and able to be integrated with other health care systems.

    amount: "$40,000"
    description: "Both static analysis and dynamic testing are important for finding defects in software applications. We propose to develop the Continuous Checking tool that would use the computer's available CPU cycles and continuously provide feedback to software developers on compilation, static analysis, and testing defects. The user can train the tool to reduce false positives reported from static analysis. Performing development in the presence of a fault (logic or semantic) lengthens the time to correct the fault as new code builds upon the fault. The longer the developer is unaware of the fault, the worse its effects will be. Continuous Checking provides the developer with information on compilation, static analysis, and testing faults while the new code is fresh in the developer's mind. We will implement Continuous Checking as a plug-in for the open source Eclipse development environment and will validate the effectiveness of the tool via empirical studies of open source programs and by working closely with CACC members."

    description: "To inform their decision making, industry professionals are most influenced by compelling evidence on the effectiveness of a technique in live situations in an environment such as their own. However, very few software engineering research studies involve industrial organizations. As a result, practitioners cannot use evidence grounded in research results to inform their decision making. Short of receiving industry-based results, practitioners may too often base their technology choices on intuition rather than evidence. The field of evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) is emerging to address these challenges. With CACC member support, we have established an exemplar industry/research collaboration focused on the examination of Extreme Programming and agile practices. We have structured and extensively performed the type of industrial case study research that is often lacking. In this proposal, we seek to continue and further this collaboration, broadening beyond Extreme Programming and agile practices to any technology or process of interest to members. As part of this research, we will adapt an Eclipse plug-in to enable detailed causal analysis of field failures and to empirically examine the defect-removal efficacy of validation and verification techniques, such as inspections, unit testing, and system testing."

This includes all third party components that are used 'off the shelf', as well as internal components where the source code is not readily available at the time of the regression test selection. It should be understood that the set of tests selected without the code is going to represent a superset of the tests that would ideally be selected if the code were available: more tests are needed, due to the lack of code, to ensure that nothing is missed."

    description: "Software inspection has been shown to be an effective defect removal practice, leading to higher quality software with lower field failures. Automated software inspection tools are emerging for identifying a subset of defects in a less labor-intensive manner than manual inspection. Results of an initial research partnership between North Carolina State University and Nortel Networks supported the use of automated inspection as an efficient predictor of field failures and are effective for identifying fault-prone modules. In this grant we propose to continue our analysis examining the potential and economic viability of automated inspection. Additionally, we will investigate incorporating automated inspection results into Nortel's Emerald decision support system."

    description: "The use of a defined process when developing software is often considered an important success strategy. As evidence, a requirement of both the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and ISO 9001 is the use of a defined process by software development teams. However, using a defined software process \"out of the box\" might cause unforeseen difficulties because the practices of the chosen process are incompatible with the project characteristics and the team culture. Thus, there is a need for a methodology for systematically constructing custom software processes to address particular problems and team characteristics. Most often, such process customization is guided by the intuition of a project lead rather than through informed decision making. While the intuition of the team lead is important, basing important tailoring decisions on instinct alone can lead to undesirable surprises. The objective of this proposal is to define and validate a methodology for identifying software development best practices or sets of best practices to guide the tailoring of defined processes. In this way, organizations can choose a set of mutually-supportive and non-conflicting practices for software development based on their project characteristics."

    amount: "$406,000"
    description: "Our nation's critical infrastructure demands that our current and future IT professionals have the knowledge, tools, and techniques to produce reliable and trustworthy software. The objective of this research is to extend, validate, and disseminate a software development practice to aid in the prevention of computer-related disasters. The practice is based upon test-driven development (TDD), a software development technique with tight verification and validation feedback loops. The proposed work extends the TDD practice and provides a supportive open-source tool for explicitly situating security and reliability as primary attributes considered in these tight feedback loops. Additionally, the research examines the composition of TDD and pair programming/pair testing as a security- and reliability-enhancing tuple of development practices. The study will also examine the potential of pair programming/pair testing for improving the success/retention of socially-oriented women, men, and minorities in the IT workforce. The intellectual merits of this proposal include an enhanced TDD-based software development practice to mitigate security concerns and a catalog of security testing patterns disseminated via the Internet. The broad impacts of the proposal include an interuniversity student competition to build excitement about developing secure and reliable software applications and a revised undergraduate software engineering textbook integrating security and reliability topics."

    amount: "$21,000"
    description: "Experience provides excellent infrastructure for software engineering education. Eclipse is readily available for student use and is a popular and effective development environment. By carefully choosing from available plug-ins, educators can customize the tool to map to the learning objectives of the course. Students learn important lessons about open source technology and program modularity. However, educators are busy and changing curricula and development platform can be time consuming. We propose the creation and the initial population of an OpenSeminar for Eclipse-based software engineering education. The OpenSeminar will enable professors from different universities to work collaboratively to create an online seminar and to customize it to the needs of their own students."

    agency: "IBM"
    duration: "November 2003 – November 2004"
    pi: "Laurie Williams"
    amount: "$40,000"
    description: "In today's software development business environment, time-to-market is a dominant factor of business success. The acceleration of change and intense competition mean that organizations need to constantly innovate or risk failure or lack of profitability. Additionally, applications must continuously evolve to meet new demands to outpace (or meet) competitive offerings. These competitive factors motivate the compression of the software development process. Typical product characteristics that suffer from such compressed development cycle are usability, reliability, and serviceability. The primary focus of this study is serviceability. Serviceability is defined as the measure of the ease of diagnosing a problem and its time to resolution once a problem is reported by a customer. The PI proposes the empirical comparison of two strategies for managing the cost of and customer satisfaction related to serviceability. Additionally, the research will explore means for proactively improving serviceability."

    description: "Agile practices relate to the dependability of software systems in two ways. First, developers rapidly cycle from one software development practice to another (such as concept, test, design, code, test, design, code, etc.). The purpose of this cycling is to get feedback early and often on decisions that have been made – from requirements decisions to design decisions and the like. This continual feedback provides \"early and often\" checks on factors that ultimately impact the dependability of the project. Additionally, the concept of agility leads to the proper mapping of the right mix of dependability practices to the determination of \"good enough dependability\" for a particular project. The determination of what is \"good enough\" is dependent upon the project characteristics and requirements. As a step in an agile dependability effort, the research team will work with Nortel to study the corporation's current practices in software dependability in relation to industry best practices. The vehicle for this study will be a web-based self-assessment questionnaire which will be administered to development organizations with a corresponding \"Best Practices in Reliability\" resource guide."

Some of these tools already can be plugged into Eclipse. We are developing extensions to this Agile methodology, and we propose to encapsulate our extensions in an Eclipse plug-in that would enable its user to estimate the probability that a software system under development performs according to its requirements based on a specified usage profile, i.e., the user would estimate its reliability based on pre-release, as well as post-release information. Specifically, we propose the development of an Eclipse plug-in to extend the current JUnit plug-in to support reliability measurement. These novel practices and this plug-in could be utilized with XP as well as other non-XP software development methodologies."

A new model, called agile software development, has emerged in recent years and is rapidly gaining in popularity and use. Agile methodologies reduce the emphasis on collecting a complete set of requirement early and, instead, incorporate new and changing requirements throughout the cycle. Proponents of these methodologies claim that their agile practices lead to more satisfied customers and to a superior success rate of delivering high quality software on-time.

    description: "Software development organizations often lack the ability to quantitatively analyze the effectiveness of their software development methodology. Additionally, these organizations are frequently unable to assess the efficacy of new practices integrated into their methodologies. This lack of information is risky and may be detrimental to the business operations of a given organization. As a case-in-point, the Extreme Programming (XP) methodology is gaining popularity at an exponential rate despite the lack of comprehensive, quantifiable studies demonstrating its effectiveness. Many feel lightweight, agile processes, such as XP, are particularly well suited for the volatile environments such as those found in emerging eCommerce application development."

    description: "The goal of our research project is to show that when undergraduate computer science students work in pairs on laboratory exercises and programming assignments, their overall learning experience is improved. Computer science educators will incorporate pair-learning into a variety of different classes, primarily at the freshman level. We will conduct educational studies to measure the impact of pair-learning on our students' aptitude for, and attitudes toward, computer science. Based on our experience, we will create and disseminate educational materials for teachers, teaching assistants, and students to support the transition from solo-learning to pair-learning. Our research has the potential to revolutionize the way that computer science is taught."

    description: "This grant proposes that a software development group in Nortel is educated in the Collaborative Software Process (CSP). Process data would be collected by the software engineers in this group. This data will be used to analyze the effectiveness of pair-programming. Additionally, some engineers would work in groups of three, practicing triad-programming. Their process data will also be analyzed to determine the effectiveness of this working arrangement. This grant also proposes the development of two software tools. One would be used for on-demand computer-based training of the CSP. The other is a process data collection and analysis tool."
