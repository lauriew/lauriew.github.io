However, while Microsoft product teams have adopted defect prediction models, they have not adopted vulnerability prediction models (VPMs). The goal of this research is to measure whether vulnerability prediction models built using standard recommendations perform well enough to provide actionable results for engineering resource allocation. We define 'actionable' in terms of the inspection effort required to evaluate model results. We replicated a VPM for two releases of the Windows Operating System, varying model granularity and statistical learners. We reproduced binary-level prediction precision (~0.75) and recall (~0.2). However, binaries often exceed 1 million lines of code, too large to practically inspect, and engineers expressed preference for source file level predictions. Our source file level models yield precision below 0.5 and recall below 0.2. We suggest that VPMs must be refined to achieve actionable performance, possibly through security-specific metrics.},

abstract = {Scientific advancement is fueled by solid fundamental research, followed by replication, meta-analysis, and theory building. To support such advancement, researchers and government agencies have been working towards a "science of security". As in other sciences, security science requires high-quality fundamental research addressing important problems and reporting approaches that capture the information necessary for replication, meta-analysis, and theory building. The goal of this paper is to aid security researchers in establishing a baseline of the state of scientific reporting in security through an analysis of indicators of scientific research as reported in top security conferences, specifically the 2015 ACM CCS and 2016 IEEE S&P proceedings. To conduct this analysis, we employed a series of rubrics to analyze the completeness of information reported in papers relative to the type of evaluation used (e.g. empirical study, proof, discussion). Our findings indicated some important information is often missing from papers, including explicit documentation of research objectives and the threats to validity. Our findings show a relatively small number of replications reported in the literature. We hope that this initial analysis will serve as a baseline against which we can measure the advancement of the science of security.},

abstract = {Software development teams are increasingly incorporating security practices in to their software development processes. However, little empirical evidence exists on the costs and benefits associated with the application of security practices. Balancing the trade off between the costs in time, effort, and complexity of applying security practices and the benefit of an appropriate level of security in delivered software requires measuring security practice benefits and costs. The goal of this research is to support researcher investigations of software development security practice adherence by building and validating a set of security practices and adherence measures through literature review and survey data analysis. We extracted 16 software development security practices from a review of the literature, and established a set of adherence measures based on technology acceptance theory. We built a survey around the 13 most common practices and our adherence measures. We surveyed 11 security-focused open source projects to collect empirical data as a test of our theorizing about practice adherence. In our collected survey data, each of the 13 security practices we identified was used daily by at least one survey participant. Tracking vulnerabilities and applying secure coding standards are the practices most often applied daily. In our data, Ease of use, Effectiveness, and Training, measured via Likert items, did not always show the expected theoretical relationship with practice use. In our data, Training is positively correlated with practice use, while Effectiveness and Ease of use vary in their correlations with practice use on a practice by practice basis.},
