Researchers have proposed and evaluated many different exploitability assessment methods. The goal of this research is to assist practitioners and researchers in understanding existing methods for assessing vulnerability exploitability through a survey of exploitability assessment literature. We identify three exploitability assessment approaches: assessments based on original, manual Common Vulnerability Scoring System, automated Deterministic assessments, and automated Probabilistic assessments. Other than the original Common Vulnerability Scoring System, the two most common sub-categories are Deterministic, Program State based, and Probabilistic learning model assessments.},

The research contributions to these two techniques have most often been focused on either one of them. However, focusing on the similarities of these two techniques and the use of a common terminology may enable a combined family of research on software configuration (a term we use to encompass both techniques) and prevent duplication of effort. The goal of this study is to aid researchers in conducting a family of research on software configuration by extending an existing model of software configuration that provides a common terminology for feature toggles and configuration options in research studies. We started with Siegmund et al.’s Model of Software Configuration (MSC), which was developed based on configuration option-related resources. We extend the MSC by qualitative analysis of feature toggle-related resources. From our analysis, we proposed MSCv2 and evaluated it through its application on publications and an industrial system. Our results indicate researchers studying the same system may provide different definitions of software configuration in publications, similar research questions may be answered repeatedly because of a lack of a clear definition of software configuration, and having an MSC may enable generalized research on this family of research.},

abstract = {As modern software extensively uses free open source packages as dependencies, developers have to regularly pull in new third-party code through frequent updates. However, without a proper review of every incoming change, vulnerable and malicious code can sneak into the codebase through these dependencies. The goal of this study is to aid developers in securely accepting dependency updates by measuring if the code changes in an update have passed through a code review process. We implement Depdive, an update audit tool for packages in Crates.io, npm, PyPI, and RubyGems registry. Depdive first (i) identifies the files and the code changes in an update that cannot be traced back to the package's source repository, i.e., <italic>phantom artifacts</italic>; and then (ii) measures what portion of changes in the update, excluding the phantom artifacts, has passed through a code review process, i.e., <italic>code review coverage</italic>. Using Depdive, we present an empirical study across the latest ten updates of the most downloaded 1000 packages in each of the four registries. We further evaluated our results through a maintainer agreement survey. We find that phantom artifacts are not uncommon in the updates (20.1\% of the analyzed updates had at least one phantom file). The phantoms can appear either due to legitimate reasons, such as in the case of programmatically generated files, or from accidental inclusion, such as in the case of files that are ignored in the repository. Regarding code review coverage (<italic>CRC</italic>), we find the updates are typically only partially code-reviewed (52.5\% of the time). Further, only 9.0\% of the packages had all their updates in our data set fully code-reviewed, indicating that even the most used packages can introduce non-reviewed code in the software supply chain. We also observe that updates either tend to have high <italic>CRC</italic> or low <italic>CRC</italic>, suggesting that packages at the opposite end of the spectrum may require a separate set of treatments.},

abstract = {Checked-in secrets in version-controlled software projects pose security risks to software and services. Secret detection tools can identify the presence of secrets in the code, commit changesets, and project version control history. As these tools can generate false positives, developers are provided with mechanisms to bypass the warnings generated from these tools. Providing this override mechanism can result in developers sometimes exposing secrets in software repositories. The goal of this article is to aid software security practitioners in understanding why‘ secrets are checked into repositories, despite being warned by tools, through an industrial case study of analysis of usage data of a secret detection tool and a survey of developers who bypassed the tool alert. In this case study, we analyzed the usage data of a checked-in secret detection tool used widely by a software company and we surveyed developers who bypassed the warnings generated by the tool. From the case study, we found that, despite developers classified 50\% of the warning as false positive, developers also bypassed the warning due to time constraints, working with non-shipping projects, technical challenges of eliminating secrets completely from the version control history, technical debts, and perceptions that check-ins are low risk. We advocate practitioners and researchers to investigate the findings of our study further to improve secret detection tools and related development practices. We also advocate that organizations should insert secondary checks, as is done by the company we studied, to capture occasions where developers incorrectly bypass secret detection tools.},

abstract = {Context: Security smells are recurring coding patterns that are indicative of security weakness and require further inspection. As infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts, such as Ansible and Chef scripts, are used to provision cloud-based servers and systems at scale, security smells in IaC scripts could be used to enable malicious users to exploit vulnerabilities in the provisioned systems. Goal: The goal of this article is to help practitioners avoid insecure coding practices while developing infrastructure as code scripts through an empirical study of security smells in Ansible and Chef scripts. Methodology: We conduct a replication study where we apply qualitative analysis with 1,956 IaC scripts to identify security smells for IaC scripts written in two languages: Ansible and Chef. We construct a static analysis tool called Security Linter for Ansible and Chef scripts (SLAC) to automatically identify security smells in 50,323 scripts collected from 813 open source software repositories. We also submit bug reports for 1,000 randomly selected smell occurrences. Results: We identify two security smells not reported in prior work: missing default in case statement and no integrity check. By applying SLAC we identify 46,600 occurrences of security smells that include 7,849 hard-coded passwords. We observe agreement for 65 of the responded 94 bug reports, which suggests the relevance of security smells for Ansible and Chef scripts amongst practitioners. Conclusion: We observe security smells to be prevalent in Ansible and Chef scripts, similarly to that of the Puppet scripts. We recommend practitioners to rigorously inspect the presence of the identified security smells in Ansible and Chef scripts using (i) code review, and (ii) static analysis tools.},

abstract = {Context: Software defect data has long been used to drive software development process improvement. If security defects (i.e.,vulnerabilities) are discovered and resolved by different software development practices than non-security defects, the knowledge of that distinction could be applied to drive process improvement.Objective: The goal of this research is to support technical leaders in making security-specific software development process improvements by analyzing the differences between the discovery and resolution of defects versus that of vulnerabilities.Method: We extend Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC) [1], a scheme for classifying software defects to support software development process improvement, to study process-related differences between vulnerabilities and defects, creating ODC + Vulnerabilities (ODC+V). We applied ODC+V to classify 583 vulnerabilities and 583 defects across 133 releases of three open-source projects (Firefox, phpMyAdmin, and Chrome).Results: Compared with defects, vulnerabilities are found later in the development cycle and are more likely to be resolved through changes to conditional logic. In Firefox, vulnerabilities are resolved 33\% more quickly than defects. From a process improvement perspective, these results indicate opportunities may exist for more efficient vulnerability detection and resolution.Figures 1 and 2 present the percentage of defects and vulnerabilities found in each Activity for Firefox and phpMyAdmin, ordered from left to right as a timeline, first by pre-release, then by postrelease. In these projects, pre-release effort in vulnerability and defect detection correlates with pre-release vulnerability and defect resolution.Conclusion: We found ODC+V's property of associating vulnerability and defect discovery and resolution events with their software development process contexts helpful for gaining insight into three open source software projects. The addition of the Securitylmpact attribute, in particular, brought visibility into when threat types are discovered during the development process. We would expect use of ODC+V (and of base ODC) periodically over time to be helpful for steering software development projects toward their quality assurance goals.We give our full report in Morrison et al.

abstract = {Context. Researchers proposing a new metric have the burden of proof to demonstrate to the research community that the metric is acceptable in its intended use. This burden of proof is provided through the multi-faceted, scientific, and objective process of software metrics validation. Over the last 40 years, however, researchers have debated what constitutes a “valid” metric.Aim. The debate over what constitutes a valid metric centers on software metrics validation criteria. The objective of this article is to guide researchers in making sound contributions to the field of software engineering metrics by providing a practical summary of the metrics validation criteria found in the academic literature.Method. We conducted a systematic literature review that began with 2,288 papers and ultimately focused on 20 papers. After extracting 47 unique validation criteria from these 20 papers, we performed a comparative analysis to explore the relationships amongst the criteria.Results. Our 47 validation criteria represent a diverse view of what constitutes a valid metric. We present an analysis of the criteria's categorization, conflicts, common themes, and philosophical motivations behind the validation criteria.Conclusions. Although the 47 validation criteria are not conflict-free, the diversity of motivations and philosophies behind the validation criteria indicates that metrics validation is complex. Researchers proposing new metrics should consider the applicability of the validation criteria in terms of our categorization and analysis. Rather than arbitrarily choosing validation criteria for each metric, researchers should choose criteria that can confirm that the metric is appropriate for its intended use. We conclude that metrics validation criteria provide answers to questions that researchers have about the merits and limitations of a metric.},

abstract = {Understanding and measuring how groups of developers collaborate on software projects can provide valuable insight into software quality and the software development process. Current practices of measuring developer collaboration (e.g. with social network analysis) usually employ metrics based on version control change log data to determine who is working on which part of the system. Version control change logs, however, do not tell the whole story. Information about the collaborative problem-solving process is also documented in the issue tracking systems that record solutions to failures, feature requests, or other development tasks. To enrich the data gained from version control change logs, we propose two annotations to be used in issue tracking systems: solution originator and solution approver. We examined the online discussions of 602 issues from the OpenMRS healthcare web application, annotating which developers were the originators of the solution to the issue, or were the approvers of the solution. We used these annotations to augment the version control change logs and found 47 more contributors to the OpenMRS project than the original 40 found in the version control change logs. Applying social network analysis to the data, we found that central developers in a developer network have a high likelihood of being approvers. These results indicate that using our two issue tracking annotations identify project collaborators that version control change logs miss. However, in the absence of our annotations, developer network centrality can be used as an estimate of the project's solution approvers. This improvement in developer activity metrics provides a valuable connection between what we can measure in the project development artifacts and the team's problem-solving process.},

abstract = {With the recent emergence of agile software development technologies, the software community is awaiting sound, empirical investigation of the impacts of agile practices in a live setting. One means of conducting such research is through industrial case studies. However, there are a number of influencing factors that contribute to the success of such a case study. In this paper, we describe a case study performed at Sabre Airline Solutions evaluating the effects of adopting Extreme Programming (XP) practices with a team that had characteristically plan-driven risk factors. We compare the team's business-related results (productivity and quality) to two published sources of industry averages. Our case study found that the Sabre team yielded above-average post-release quality and average to above-average productivity. We discuss our experience in conducting this case study, including specifics of how data was collected, the rationale behind our process of data collection, and what obstacles were encountered during the case study. We also identify four factors that potentially impact the outcome of industrial case studies: availability of data, tool support, co-operative personnel and project status. We believe that recognizing and planning for these factors is essential to conducting industrial case studies, and that this information will be helpful to researchers and practitioners alike.},

abstract = {Those science, mathematics, and engineering faculty who are serious about making the education they offer as available to their daughters as to their sons are, we posit, facing the prospect of dismantling a large part of its traditional pedagogical structure, along with the assumptions and practice which support it. [Seymour and Hewett 1997].Prior research indicates that female students can be concerned about the insularity of working alone for long periods of time, as they perceive to be the case with computer science and information technology careers. We studied an advanced undergraduate software engineering course at North Carolina State University to characterize the potential of collaborative learning environments created via pair-programming and agile software development to ameliorate this concern. A collective case study of three representative women in the course revealed that they held the following four themes in common: working with others; productivity; confidence; and interest in IT careers. Three conjectures concerning collaboration emerged from our study, including the importance of face-to-face meetings, an increased confidence among women based on product quality, and a reduction in the amount of time spent on assignments. While our findings are not generalized to early undergraduate courses, the young women we studied were at a critical junction in deciding whether to pursue a career in IT upon their near-term graduation. Additionally, we propose a model for future testing with both males and females that connects these three factors with an increased interest in IT careers.},
