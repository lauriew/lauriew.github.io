abstract = {A recent survey conducted on the SIGCSE mailing list indicated that up to 80\% of CS1, CS2, and data structures instructors allow students to collaborate. The use of collaboration increases as students advance through the computer science curriculum. Some computer science educators use pair programming as the model for their student collaboration, sometimes with mixed results. At North Carolina State University, over a thousand students have pair programmed in CS1, undergraduate software engineering, and graduate level courses over the last seven years. This paper provides a summary of the lessons we have learned through experience and through extensive research over this period.},

abstract = {Software products are often built from commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components. When new releases of these components are made available for integration and testing, source code is usually not provided by the vendors. Various regression test selection techniques have been developed and have been shown to be cost effective. However, the majority of these test selection techniques rely on source code for change identification and impact analysis. In our research, we have evolved a regression test selection (RTS) process called Integrated - Black-box Approach for Component Change Identification (I-BACCI) for COTS-based applications. I-BACCI reduces the test suite based upon changes in the binary code of the COTS component using the firewall regression test selection method. In this paper, we present the Pallino tool. Pallino statically analyzes binary code to identify the code change and the impact of these changes. Based on the output of Pallino and the original test suit, testers can determine the regression test cases needed to cover the application glue code which is affected by the changed areas in the new version of the COTS component. Three case studies, examining a total of fifteen component releases, were conducted on ABB internal products. With the help of Pallino, RTS via the I-BACCI process can be completed in about one to two person hours for each release of the case studies. The total size of application and component for each release is about 340 830 KLOC. Pallino is extensible and can be modified to support other RTS methods for COTS components. Currently, Pallino works on components in Common Object File Format or Portable Executable formats},
